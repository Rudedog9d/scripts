# Bash Scripts

A gathering place for some of the bash scripts I have created

#### java-init.sh
A quick script to create a folder, file, and copy a simple "Hello World" program into the file as a place to start. Used for my CS249 class at SUNY POLY

#### pdf2png.sh
Use the `imagemagick` package to convert all of the files matching the `Files` string to a png file
