# scripts
Just some quick and dirty scripts for whatever

Bear in mind most of these were made in a hurry, and most likely while half asleep :)

#### java-init.sh
A quick script to create a folder, file, and copy a simple "Hello World" program into the file as a place to start. Used for my CS249 class at SUNY POLY
